Mitrid is a framework for building blockchains. It is meant to be flexible enough to cover different architectures (permissionless and permissioned; with authenticated chains, trees or directed graphs) and to let users use the cryptographical protocols they prefer. Add-ons will be added to ease development.

<br>
Mitrid-core is the heart of the Mitrid framework and provides its models and crypto traits.
